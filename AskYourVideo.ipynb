we're bringing Apple Vision Pro to these eight countries next starting with China Japan and Singapore on June 28th and Australia Canada France Germany and the United Kingdom on July 12th now here's Craig to tell you all about what's coming in iOS [Music] iOS 18 is a big release that delivers more ways to customize your iPhone stay connected and relive special moments first let's talk about a set of features that give you exciting new ways to personalize your iPhone further starting with your home screen you can already customize your home screen with your favorite wallpaper apps and widgets letting your personality shine through and now your app icons and widgets can add even more let me show you I have this photo I love as my wallpaper and now I can continue to enjoy it when I unlock my iPhone because I can arrange my apps and widgets to frame it perfectly I can select them all and easily place them along the bottom right above the dock for easy access or even off to the side and check this out we have an awesome new look for app icons when we go into dark mode let's turn it on Isn't that cool now in addition to this new dark look there are even more new ways to adjust how they look I can bring up a new customization sheet and now I can tint them all with color iOS suggests a tint color that complement my wallpaper or I can select any other color I want now they really pop it's so easy to create just the right look whether you prefer the classic look or want to go dark or style with color there are so many possibilities to make your home screen truly your own we're also bringing new levels of customization and capability to control center helping you access many of the things you do every day even faster let's take a look when I swipe from the top right corner I can see control center with all my controls organized in one place and now control center isn't limited to just the controls you see here I can swipe to multiple new groups of controls like for media playback you can see how beautiful this looks and here are my home controls it's so useful to have everything arranged for me like this oh that shouldn't be open let me close the garage and what's really great is I can get to any one of these groups with a single continuous swipe I can get straight to my home controls for instance or right back up to the top to add more controls I can open up the new controls Gallery where I have so many options to choose from we wanted to make control center more extensible than ever so now developers can include controls from their apps as well like this one from Ford let's add that in I can adjust how my controls are laid out and resize them too now I can cool down the car just like that so that's the new control center to enable new controls and control center we have a new controls API for developers and that's not all these new controls are also available from the lock screen so you can swap a camera and flashlight for different controls like taking a note when an idea strikes or quickly capturing the moment for your Snapchat and you can even use the action button on iPhone 15 Pro to invoke these new controls another key part of personalizing iOS is about keeping you in control of your privacy an iOS 18 gives you even more ways to control who can see your apps how you share your contacts and how you connect to accessories let's start with apps sometimes we hand our device to someone so they can look at a photo or play a game but we want peace of mind that they can't get into sensitive areas of our phone so this year we're giving you a new way to protect sensitive apps and the information inside them by letting you lock an app when you choose to lock an app if someone else tries to tap it they will be required to authenticate using face ID Touch ID or your passcode and information from inside the app won't appear in other places across the system like in Search and notifications so others won't inadvertently see sensitive information there may also be occasions when you want to hide an app that you don't want others to know is installed on your device for example say you use a professional grade spatial capture app to track your different hairstyles I mean that's just good sign science right well anyway say you use this app but you don't want anyone else to know well now you can hide it and put it in a new hidden apps folder that's locked we're also adding new ways to control how you share information with apps starting with contacts today when you give an app access to your contacts it can learn about all the people you've added over time in iOS 18 we're putting you in control by letting you decide which contacts an app can see we're also putting you in control when you pair accessories an app may ask for Bluetooth and local network access but also gain visibility to all the other devices on your network from your computers and TVs to your door locks and blood pressure monitor now developers can offer you an intuitive new way to pair your accessories that keeps your devices private and makes pairing seamless next up we have big enhancements to apps we use to stay connected starting with messages to tell you more here's ronic messages is Central to how we communicate with the most important people in our lives so in iOS 18 we're giving you all new ways to express yourself and stay connected let's start with tapbacks tapbacks are one of the most popular ways to express yourself in messages and people love them this is a huge year for tapbacks we've not only redesigned your favorites we're now giving you Limitless ways to express yourself by letting you tap back with any Emoji or sticker next we're bringing one of your most requested features to messages when you don't want to forget to send that friendly reminder or birthday text in the morning you can schedule your message to send later we're also giving you more ways to express your tone with text formatting bold italicize underline or strike through any text and when formatting is not enough we're introducing a new way to visually amplify your messages with text effects whether you want to emphasize some major news bring your emoji to life or you're just blown away by a stunning photo you can express yourself in all new ways with text effects some words and phrases automatically surface a suggestion so you can quickly select one and send it and you can also add one of the many new effects to any text last there's a new way to stay connected whenever you don't have Wi-Fi or cellular service we're using the same groundbreaking technology that gave us emergency SOS via satellite to bring you messages via satellite now you can use the satellite capabilities on iPhone 14 and later to connect to satellites hundreds of miles above the Earth to text your friends and family when you're off the grid all right from the messages app one once you're connected you'll be able to use key iMessage features like sending and receiving messages emoji and tapbacks because iMessage was built to protect your privacy iMessages sent over satellite are endtoend encrypted and if you need to text people not on iMessage we're supporting SMS messaging via satellite too now let's talk about another app we use to communicate mail this year we're giving you a new way to stay in control and manage incoming email with on device categorization that organizes your messages and helps you stay up to date across all of your accounts the primary category enables you to focus on what matters most emails from people you know and time-sensitive messages the rest of your email will be organized into new categories like transactions for receipts and Order confirmations updates for newsletters and social media notices and promotions from marketing and sales messages and these categories do more than just sort your mail we've also created an elegant new digest view that pulls together all the relevant emails you've received from a business to make interacting with these messages even easier for instance it can bring together all of your flight information from United so you can get to it in one place you can quickly scan Snippets of each message to see what's new and explore what you're interested in if you want a sender to appear in another category you can recategorize them with just a few tabs archiving or deleting all of the messages from a business is just as easy and of course you can always see all of your emails in one place categorization will be available later this

take a look at an exciting new feature that can transform the way you work out whether you're training for something like your first 5k or your fastest marathon in watchos 11 we're introducing training load an insightful way to measure how the intensity and duration of your workouts are impacting your body over time to track intensity we design a new way to rate your workouts using calorimetry data like heart rate pace and elevation plus your personal data like age and weight a powerful new algorithm automatically translates our sensor data into an estimate of your effort rating after your workout you can review the rating on the summary page ranging from one easy to 10 all out and you can even adjust your effort rating up or down to get it just right your effort rating and workout duration are then used to calculate your training load you'll be able to see if you're holding steady above your average and can safely progress and improve or when you're well above your average and should pay close attention to better avoid exhaustion or injury we think training load will help enthusiasts and Elite athletes get to the next level with Data Insights and motivation they need to make the best decisions about about their training and we've now made it even easier for everyone to gain more insights from the fitness app on iPhone by giving you the ability to customize the summary tab to show the information you want to see including new metrics like weekly running distance the personalization even extends to your activity Rings where you can now adjust your goals by the day of the week or if you have an injury that's making it harder to close your rings or maybe you just need a day off you can pause them for a rest day week or more and keep your award streak

vitals app where you can check in on your daily health status and explore your most important Health metrics with just a glance you can also see how your metrics relate to your typical range which is determined from your own historical information and an algorithm developed using real world data from the Apple heart movement study for additional insights your metrics will be highlighted when they're outside of your typical range with details on what's changed over the last week and when multiple metrics are out of range you'll be notified with a tailored message to help you understand how these changes may be linked to other aspects of your life such as alcohol elevation changes or even illness and that's the vitals app a new way to quickly view your most important Health metrics receive alerts when it's time to pay more attention to your body and gain better context when it comes to your health now let's talk talk about another time when context about your health matters which is during pregnancy cycle tracking can now show you gestational age to support you during this important time the health app will display your pregnancy across all charts and prompt you to review things like your high heart rate notification threshold since heart rate often increases during pregnancy those are some of the advances in health and now back to David to tell you what's coming to keep you connected with Apple watch you can have quick and meaningful interactions right on your wrist making it so easy to stay connected to the world around you and the people you care about without always needing to take your iPhone out of your pocket whether it's using Apple pay to buy your morning coffee or hop on the subway telling Siri to add an item to your grocery list or replying to a message from a friend you can do it all with just the raise of a wrist and last year we introduce the smart stack it's another way to keep you connected to important information with just a scroll of the digital crown this year it becomes even more intelligent by automatically adding new widgets right when you need them like the precipitation widget to alert you before it rains or the translate widget for when you're traveling somewhere new just tap to open the new translate app on Apple watch which uses machine learning models for speech recognition and translation you can now simply dictate to see and hear it right on your wrist the smart stack also becomes more capable with live activities coming to Apple watch so you'll have all the details for your favorite events and you can use features like check-in which lets a friend know you made it back home safely and is now on Apple watch with additional support for workouts during a late night run your friend will know to keep an eye out and will be updated when you end your workout so you both have peace of mind developers can also show live activities in the smart stack so you can see updates in the moment like when your ride is coming for apps like uber and with the new double tap API they can also Define actions within apps like Sprout baby tracker to log your baby's time of sleep without waking them having access to all of these powerful capabilities right on your wrist makes Apple watch so indispensable and being able to customize your watch face is one of the ways that makes it incredibly personal to you with the popular photos face there is something special about seeing an important person or moment every time you raise your wrist now watch away S1 will help you find the perfect photos for your watch face machine learning intelligently identifies scores and curates the best photos based on facial expressions Aesthetics and composition then a custom algorithm elegantly frames the image with the time you can select a bold color choose monotone for Sleek look or create something that is unique and personal to you that's what's coming in watchos 11 a redesigned photo face a more intelligent smart stack training load the vital app new apis for developers and so much more like turn-by-turn directions for walking and hiking routes you've created we are so excited about all the new ways to help you stay connected active and healthy back to you cig [Music] next let's talk about iPad OS which Powers our strongest lineup ever including the incredibly thin and Powerful iPad Pro and the redesigned iPad Air now available in two sizes together with the latest versions of Final Cut Pro and logic pro and game-changing accessories like apple pencil Pro and magic keyboard it creates an experience that's in a category of its own our next release iPad OS 18 starts with features you saw on iOS like new ways to personalize your home screen customize Control Center and relive special moments in the photos app iPad OS 18 also brings exciting new ways to get things done reimagined with apple pencil and a big update to apps designed for the distinct capabilities of iPad apps are fundamental to the iPad experience in iPad OS 18 we're making them even better starting with a new floating tab bar which makes it easier to navigate to different parts of an app and keeps your content edgo Edge in apps like Apple TV when you want to explore more the tab bar morphs into the sidebar if you use a specific tab often you can customize the tab bar to keep your favorites within easy Reach This redesigned experience Works in apps across the system we've also made it easier to browse your documents in apps like Pages keynote numbers and Swift playgrounds giving each app a distinct new look and throughout your experience you'll discover refined animations you'll notice them as you open files or preview them with quick look and they smoothly zoom into view or when the tab bar elegantly morphs into the sidebar and back across apps animations will feel even more responsive and for developers all these new elements are available as apis to adopt in your apps too now let's take a look at updates to shareplay and free form one of share play's best features is screen sharing it's a great way to help friends and family from afar and we're making it better in two ways now you can tap and draw on your screen to point out what they should do on theirs and if you need to assist more directly you can ask for permission to remotely control their iPad or iPhone I hope that helps and free form adds scenes an all new way to select sections of a board to present them one by one next I want to talk about a feat that some may have concluded must be a mathematical impossibility that's right we're bringing calculator to iPad y by leveraging what makes iPad so unique it makes solving math easier than ever it starts with the calculator that you know from iPhone updated to take advantage of the larger iPad display along with some new tricks like history and unit conversions but the real magic of calculator and iPad is unlocked when you use it with your apple pencil an iPad superpower apple pencil has changed the way you can take notes draw and even design with iPad and now it's changing the way you do math with a feature we call math notes let's see it in action with Jenny I'm so excited to show you the new math notes experience I get to it by just tapping the new calculator button right here and with my apple pencil I'll just start writing out expressions like I would on a piece of paper as soon as I write an equal sign calculator immediately solves it for me and even shows me the results and handwriting like my own when I make a change the results update live and I can go beyond basic math with all of the same functions from the scientific calculator I can save my math notes and come back to them later if I'm working on different things like here where I'm working on a budget for my team's upcoming table tennis tournament since I'm in math noes I can sum these costs quickly by just drawing a line underneath them it's so natural math notes are also really powerful when it comes to more complex math here I have a physics problem my teammate and I are working on we're calculating the maximum height of a table tennis ball when I hit it with different speeds and angles math notes supports variables so I've declared a few here and there's an expression below which uses these variables to help me calculate the height what's powerful about variables is that if I change one like the velocity of my shot it will change the related results too and if I want to see how this speed impacts the height visually I can I'll just put y equals in front of this equation and now when I tap the equal sign I have an option to create a graph and if I'm curious how the height will be impacted by the angle of my shot I can hover my pencil over the angle and adjust it to see how it affects my graph in real time it's an easy way to explore equations in math and that's just a quick look at math notes in calculator back to ukra math notes are perfect for working through a problem set or just tackling the math we run into Data day and this all works in Notes too when you need to crunch numbers notes has all the new math capabilities from calculator just as we've reimagined math on iPad we've also reimagined handwriting in notes with a new feature called smart script notes already has great handwriting features like the ability to select and copy your writing or even make it straighter with smart script we're making handwriting your notes smoother than ever it starts with improving the appearance of your writing as you write we use a powerful on device machine learning model to recreate your handwriting style from your notes which unlocks new capabilities just scribble your thoughts as fast as you have them and smart script refines your handwriting as you go it's still your own writing but it looks smoother straighter and more legible smart script further accelerates your writing Flow by making handwriting just as flexible as type text now you can just paste type text into a handwritten note and it will appear in your own style spell check works just as you would expect and fixes mistakes in line when you decide you need to add to something you've already written just tap and hold with your apple pencil and your text Will flow out of the way to create more space if you want to erase something you can just scratch it out smart script makes your handwritten notes more effective fluid and easier to read and with other enhancements to type notes including collapsible sections it's never been a better time to be a note taker and that's iPad OS 18 taking the distinct experience of iPad further with a big update to apps that makes navigating easier and more responsive and new ways to work that have been reimagined with apple pencil next let's talk about Mac [Music] OS the allstar combination of the power of Apple silicon and the legendary ease of use of MACC OS have made the Mac more capable than ever and we're so excited to take Mac OS to new heights and embark on the next chapter of our journey of productivity and creativity but what should we call it well that brings us once again to the annual escapades of our legendary crack marketing team distracted briefly from the marathon hacky sack session they stumbled into their minius and wo a trail toward the Sierra eventually rolling to a stop in a beautiful National Park staring Skyward up the Towering trunks surrounding them they felt a deep kinship with anything that could get that high they knew they'd found their spot welcome to Mac OS Sequoia the incredible features we talked about in iOS 18 and iPad OS 18 are going to be amazing for the ways you use Mac you can be even more expressive in mess Mees math notes provide a helpful typed experience and you can easily plan a hike in maps these new features are terrific on the Mac and Mac OS Sequoia introduces even more features to help you effortlessly get things done let's start with continuity continuity helps you do so much more when you use Apple products together it Powers some of your favorite features like Universal clipboard universal control and Mac virtual display on Apple Vision Pro and Mac OS Sequoia makes continuity even more magical for all those times when we want to use our iPhone only to realize it's tucked away in a bag over in another room there's a brand new continuity feature called iPhone mirroring with iPhone mirroring on Mac I can see what's on my iPhone and can control it too all while barely lifting a finger let me show you how it works to access my phone I just click here in my dock boom and there's my iPhone mirrored in a window right on my Mac I can fully interact with it all wirelessly I can see my custom wallpaper my icons are right where they belong and I can use my phone normally like swiping through pages of my home screen and I can open any of my iPhone apps like the Phil's Coffee app for a bit of extra energy for my favorite local coffee shop I can use my Mac trackpad to interact with the app and I can use my Mac keyboard too like to add special instructions let's make this ice [Music] cold to make this even more magical we're bringing iPhone notifications to Mac they appear alongside my Mac notifications and I can even interact with them when I don't have my iPhone handy here's one from dualink what's neat is when I click on it bam I'm taken right into the dualingo app on my iPhone so I can practice my Spanish and extend my streak L as you can hear my iPhone's audio even comes through my Mac so you might be wondering what's on my iPhone screen while I'm using iPhone mirroring it stays locked so nobody else can access it and it works seamlessly with standby standby stays visible so I can get information at a glance as I use my phone with iPhone mirroring an iPhone mirroring makes it effortless to combine the power of my Mac and the convenience of its big screen with the things I get done on my iPhone I'm using a template in the unfold app to make a post and I've got one last video to add on Mac I've been using Final Cut Pro to stitch some clips together watch how easy it is to use my devices together I can grab the exported video and just drop it right into the template perfect so that's iPhone mirroring and Mac OS Sequoia has fantastic updates to how you arrange your windows share while video conference and organize your passwords now when you drag a window to the edge of the screen Mac OS automatically suggests a tiled position on your desktop you can release your window right into place quickly Place tiles side by side or place them into Corners to keep even more apps in your view and new keyboard and menu shortcuts help you arrange your tiles even faster now let's talk about video conferencing when you're on a video call say goodbye to overshare shing with the new presenter preview it lets you see what you're about to share before you share it and works with apps like FaceTime and zoom and when you want to express yourself or just hide the laundry behind you you can now replace your background with some beautiful built-in backgrounds or your own photos background Replacements use Apple's industry-leading segmentation so you look your best while on a call now let's talk about how we're building on the foundation of keychain to help you manage your passwords for over 25 years we've been adding features to make logging into your accounts easier and now we're introducing the passwords app passwords makes it easy to access your credentials and have them securely stored all in one place everything is organized for you from your passwords to Verification codes to security alerts you can find the app on Mac iPad iPhone Vision

are on the way creating a stellar lineup of titles to look forward to so that's gaming which wraps up Mac OS Sequoia it's a big release that up levels your productivity and creativity you can quickly tile windows for your ideal workspace a massive update to Safari helps you browse the web distraction free an amazing host of new gaming titles are coming to the Mac an iPhone mirroring let you wirelessly use your iPhone right from your Mac Mac OS joins the announcements across our platforms and this is a huge year for developers with brilliant new features and apis coming so they can supercharge their apps and experiences developer betas will be available today public betas will be available next month and all of our OS releases will be available to users this fall back to Tim [Music] at Apple it's always been our goal to design powerful personal products that enrich people's lives by enabling them to do the things that matter most as simply and easily as possible we've been using artificial intelligence and machine learning for years to help us further that goal recent developments in generative intelligence and large language models offer powerful capabilities that provide the opportunity to take the experience of using Apple products to new heights so as we look to build in these incredible new capabilities we want to ensure that the outcome reflects the principles at the core of our products it has to be powerful enough to help with the things that matter most to you it has to be intuitive and easy to use it has to be deeply integrated into your product EXP experiences most importantly it has to understand you and be grounded in your personal context like your routine your relationships your Communications and more and of course it has to be built with privacy from the ground up together all of this goes beyond artificial intelligence it's personal intelligence and it's the next big step for Apple [Music] [Applause] [Music] introducing Apple intelligence the new personal intelligence system that makes your most personal products even more useful and delightful to tell you all about it here's [Music] Craig this is a moment we've been working towards for a long time we're tremendously excited about the power of generative models and there are already some really impressive chat tools out there that perform a vast array of tasks using World Knowledge but these tools know very little about you or your needs with iOS 18 iPad OS 18 and Mac OS Sequoia we are embarking on a New Journey to bring you intelligence that understands you Apple intelligence is the personal intelligence system that puts powerful generative models right at the core of your iPhone iPad and Mac it draws on your personal context to give you intelligence that's most helpful and relevant for you it protects your privacy at every step and it is deeply integrated into our platforms and throughout the apps you rely on to communicate work and express yourself let's take a closer look at Apple intelligence starting with its incredible capabilities then we'll tell you about its unique architecture and after that we'll show you how it elevates so many of your everyday experiences let's begin with capabilities Apple intelligence will enable your iPhone iPad and Mac to understand and create language as well as images and take action for you to simplify interactions across your apps and what's truly unique is its understanding of your personal context language and text are fundamental to how we communicate and work and the large language models built into Apple intelligence deliver deep natural language understanding making so many of your day-to-day tasks faster and easier for example your iPhone can prioritize your notifications to minimize unnecessary distractions while ensuring you don't miss something important Apple intelligence also Powers brand new writing tools that you can access systemwide to feel more confident in your writing writing tools can rewrite proofread and summarized text for you whether you're working on an article or blog post condensing ideas to share with your classmates or looking over a review before you post it online and they're available automatically across mail notes Safari Pages keynote and even your third party apps in addition to language Apple intelligence offers a host of capabilities for images from photos to emojis and Gifts it's so much fun to express ourselves visually and now you can create totally original images to make everyday conversations even more enjoyable and because Apple intelligence understands the people in your photo library you can personalize these images for your conversations so so when you wish a friend a happy birthday you can create an image of them surrounded by Cake balloons and flowers to make it extra festive and the next time you tell Mom that she's your hero you can send an image of her in a superhero Cate to really land your point you can create images in three unique Styles sketch illustration and animation in addition to messages this experience is built into Apps throughout the system like notes free form keynote and Pages another way Apple intelligence is deeply impactful is its ability to take action across your apps the greatest source of tools for taking actions is already in your pocket with the apps you use every day and we have designed Apple intelligence so it can tap into these tools and Carry Out tasks on your behalf so you can say things like pull up the files that Jaws shared with me last week or show me all the photos of mom Olivia and me or play the podcast that my wife sent the other day we're designing Apple intelligence to be able to orchestrate these and hundreds of other actions for you so you can accomplish more while saving time there's one more critical building block for personal intelligence and that's an understanding of your personal context Apple intelligence is grounded in your personal information and context with the ability to retrieve and analyze the most relevant data from across your apps as well as to reference the content on your screen like an email or calendar event you're looking at this can be incredibly useful in so many moments throughout the day suppose one of my meetings being rescheduled for late in the afternoon and I'm wondering if it's going to prevent me from getting to my daughter's play performance on time Apple intelligence can process the relevant personal data to assist me it can understand who my daughter is the play detail she sent several days ago the time and location for my meeting and predicted traffic between my office and the theater understanding this kind of personal context is essential for delivering truly helpful intelligence but it has to be done right you should not have to hand over all the details of your life to be warehoused and analyzed in someone's AI cloud with apple intelligence powerful intelligence goes hand inand with powerful privacy let me tell you more about its architecture and how it's built with privacy at the core the Cornerstone of the personal intelligence system is on device processing we have integrated it deep into your iPhone iPad and mac and throughout your apps so it's aware of your personal data without collecting your personal data this is only possible through our unique integration of hardware and software and our yearslong investment in building advanced silicon for on device intelligence deeply integrated generative models require immense processing power and with our most advanced Apple silicon the A7 Pro and M family of chips we have the computational foundation to power Apple intelligence this personal intelligence system is comprised of Highly capable large language and diffusion models that are specialized for your everyday tasks and can adapt on the- fly to your current activity it also includes an on device semantic index that can organize and surface information from across your apps when you make a request Apple intelligence uses its semantic index to identify the relevant personal data and feeds it to the generative model so they have the personal context to best assist you many of these models run entirely on device there are times though when you need models that are larger than what fits in your pocket today servers can help with this but traditionally servers can also store your data without you realizing it and use it in ways you did not intend and since server software is only accessible to its owners even if a company says it's not misusing your data you're unable to verify their claim or if it changes over time in contrast when you use an Apple device like your iPhone you are in control of your data where it is stored and who can access it and because the software image for your iPhone is accessible to Independent experts they can continuously verify its privacy we want to extend the privacy and security of your iPhone into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence for you so we have created private Cloud compute private Cloud compute allows Apple intelligence to flex and scale its computational capacity and draw on even larger server-based models for more complex requests while protecting your privacy these models run on servers we've especially created using Apple silicon these Apple silicon servers offer the privacy and security of your iPhone from the Silicon on up draw on the security properties of the Swift programming language and run software with transparency built in when you make a request Apple intelligence analyzes whether it can be processed on device if it needs greater computational capacity it can draw on private Cloud compute and send only the data dat that's relevant to your task to be processed on Apple silicon servers your data is never stored or made accessible to Apple it's used exclusively to fulfill your request and just like your iPhone independent experts can inspect the code that runs on these servers to verify this privacy promise in fact private Cloud compute cryptographically ensures your iPhone iPad and Mac will refuse to talk to a server unless its software has has been publicly logged for inspection this sets a brand new standard for privacy and Ai and unlocks intelligence you can trust so that's a look at the powerful capabilities of Apple intelligence and its groundbreaking privacy protections now we'd love to show you how it will transform your apps and experiences across iOS 18 iPad OS 18 and Mac OS Sequoia from a big leap forward for Siri to power tools for writing and communication and fun visual ways to express yourself let's start with Siri here's Kelsey to tell you more today Siri helps you get everyday tasks done quickly and easily in fact Siri users make 1.5 billion voice requests every single day 13 years ago we introduced Siri the original intelligent assistant and we had an ambitious vision for it we've been steadily building towards that vision and now thanks to the incredible power of Apple intelligence we have the foundational capabilities to take a major step forward so we can make Siri more natural more contextually relevant and of course more personal to you right off the bat you'll see Siri's got a new look let me show you when you talk to Siri you'll notice it's more deeply integrated into the system experience with this elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of your screen and you can speak to Siri more naturally thanks to richer language understanding capabilities Even If I Stumble over my words Siri understands what I'm getting at what does the weather look like for tomorrow at Mir Beach oh wait I meant Mir Woods the forecast is calling for clear skies in the morning near mer Woods National Monument sometimes it takes me a beat to figure out what I actually want to ask Siri and now it follows right along Siri also maintains conversational context so I can follow up and say create an event for a hike there tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. hike is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on June 11th I didn't have to mention mirwoods again Siri understood what I meant when I said there there are also certain times when you might not want to speak to Siri out loud what's great is that now at any time you have the option to type to Siri with with just a double tap at the bottom of the screen I can quickly and quietly ask Siri to set an alarm and you can switch between text and voice communicating in whatever way feels right for the moment we're also laying the groundwork for some brand new ways that Siri will be able to support you one of which is its extensive product knowledge Siri now holds a great deal of information about features and settings and can answer thousands of questions when you want to know how to do something on your iPhone iPad or Mac even if you don't know exactly what a feature is called you can just describe it and Sir will find the info you're looking for like this how can I write a message now and have it be delivered tomorrow Siri understood what feature I was referring to and now I have step-by-step guidance on how to use the new sen later feature in messages everything I've showed you so far will be available from the moment you start using Apple intell and over the course of the next year we'll be rolling out more features that make Siri even more personal and capable for one apple intelligence will provide Siri with onscreen awareness so it'll be able to understand and take action with things on your screen for example say a friend texts you his new address right from the messages thread you can say add this address to his contact card and Siri will take care of it Siri will also understand more of the things you could done in your apps and with new orchestration capabilities provided by Apple intelligence Siri will take actions inside apps on your behalf Siri will have the ability to take hundreds of new actions in and across apps including some that leverage our new writing and image generation capabilities for example you'll be able to say show me my photos of Stacy in New York wearing her pink coat and siral will bring those right up then you might say make this photo pop and Siri will enhance it just like that and Siri will be able to take actions across apps so you could say add this to my note with Stacy's bio and it will jump from the photos app to the notes app to make it happen this is going to bring us closer to realizing our vision in which the moves through the system in concert with you this is made possible through significant enhancements that we're making to app intense a framework that lets apps Define a set of actions for Siri shortcuts and other system experiences and this won't be limited to apps made by Apple for developers they'll be able to use the app intense framework to Define actions in their apps and tap into Apple intelligence too so you might ask Siri to take a light Trails video in Pro Camera by moment or ask Siri to share a summary of your meeting notes in an email your drafting to a teammate and superhuman and this is only the beginning Siri will be able to understand and take more actions in more apps over time there's one more set of really cool and useful capabilities coming to Siri thanks to Apple intelligence it has awareness of your personal context with its semantic index of things like photos calendar events and files plus information that's stashed in passing messages and emails like hotel bookings PDFs of concert tickets and links that your friends have shared will find and understand things it never could before and with the powerful privacy protections of Apple intelligence Siri will use this information to help you get things done without compromising your privacy you'll be able to ask Siri to find something when you can't remember if it was in an email a text or a shared note like some book recommendations that a friend sent you a while back or for times when you're filling out a form and need to input your driver's license see will be able to find a photo of your license extract your ID number and type it into the form for you I want to show you one more demo that will give you a sense for how powerful Siri will be when it draws on the personal context awareness and action capabilities built into Apple intelligence imagine that I'm planning to pick my mom up from the airport and I'm trying to figure out my timing Siri is going to be able to help me do this so easily Siri when is my mom 's flight landing what's awesome is that Siri actually cross references flight details that my mom shared with me by email with realtime flight tracking to give me her upto-date arrival time what's our lunch plan I don't always remember to add things to my calendar and so I love that Siri can help me keep track of plans that I've made in casual conversation like this lunch reservation my mom mentioned in a text how long will it take us to get there from the airport I haven't had to jump from mail to messages to maps to figure out this plan and a set of tasks that would have taken minutes on my own and honestly probably would have resulted in a call to my mom could be addressed in a matter of seconds that's just a glimpse of the ways in which Siri is going to become more powerful and more personal thanks to Apple intelligence and all of these updates to Siri are also coming to iPad and Mac where Siri's new design is a total GameChanger it makes Siri feel seamlessly integrated with your workflow thanks to the capabilities of Apple intelligence this year marks the start of a new era for Siri here's Justin to show you more places throughout the system where Apple intelligence simplifies and accelerates your tasks Apple intelligence unlocks incredible new ways to enhance your writing whether you're tidying up your hastily written class notes ensuring your blog post reads just right on WordPress we're making sure your email is perfectly crafted let's use mail to take a closer look look at how the systemwide writing tools can help you communicate even more effectively rewrite gives you different versions of what you've written so you can choose the one you like best this is great for making sure your cover letter for that job you're excited for lands perfectly and suggestions are shown in line so you can go with the combination of flow and wording that works for you rewrite also helps you get the tone right have you ever reread a work email that you just wrote and thought Oh this might not go over well well now you can change the tone of that response to your colleague to make it sound more friendly professional or concise you can also describe how you'd like it Rewritten for example you can invite your friends to a get together with a one-of-a-kind invitation written as a poem who could say no to that another way writing tools can help you is with proofread say your email your English Professor with proofread you can nail grammar word choice and sentence structure to put your best foot forward you can review suggested edits and their explanations individually or accept them all with a click and if you're about to email a project status that has gotten quite long use summarize to bring out the key points and then add them as a tldr right at the top in addition to mail you can access R tools systemwide nearly everywhere you write including third party apps Apple intelligence also Powers smart reply in mail for example when you need to RSVP to an event you will now see suggestions for your response based on the email if you say you'll be there mail identifies questions you were asked in the invite and offers intelligent selections so you can quickly choose your responses your drafted response incorporates your answers so with just a few Taps you're ready to send it off with all the right details finally let's talk about how Apple intelligence helps you stay on top of a busy inbox we all deal with soring through a ton of email every day and now it's easier and faster than ever to browse your inbox instead of previewing the first few lines of each email that don't always convey the most useful information you can now see summaries visible right from your email list so without even opening the email you'll know that your team is meeting on Thursday to discuss a new design and if you jump into a particularly long email when you're in a hurry you can tap to reveal a summary at the top of the email and cut right to the chase we're also elevating priority messages Apple intelligence can understand the content of the emails you receive determine what's most urgent and surface it right at the top like a dinner invite for tonight or a boarding pass for your trip this afternoon and deep understanding of language extends beyond your inbox into more places like your notifications first just like in mail your priority notifications appear at the top of the stack letting you know what to pay attention to At a Glance and to make scanning your notifications faster they're summarized so when the group chat is blown up you can quickly see that sevita booked the house and Leah is arriving early right from your lock screen Apple intelligence also enables an allnew focus called reduce interruptions it understands the content of your notification to selectively surface only the ones that might need immediate attention like a text about today's daycare pickup from catching up on priority notifications to staying present and focused with reduced interruptions and refining your words with writing tools Apple intelligence helps you save time in so many ways now over to Cyrus to show you how it unlocks new ways to express yourself Apple intelligence enables you to create fun original images whether you are sprucing up a key for class or trying to land an idea while collaborating in free form and third party apps can offer this experience too like in craft where you can create a delightful image to add to your document let's take a closer look at how Apple intelligence helps you express yourself visually in messages one of the most fun ways to communicate in messages is with Emoji but even with thousands of emoji to choose from there are times when you can't quite find the right one for how you feel so we're introducing gen mooji leveraging the power of Apple intelligence you can create gen mooji on device right in the keyboard and match any moment perfectly just provide a description and you'll see your gen Emoji appear right before your eyes along with more options to choose from this is great in those times when you're updating a friend about your relaxing weekend getting the group chat excited about brunch or complaining about the Rowdy squirrel right outside your window and because Apple intelligence is aware of who's in your photo library you can simply pick someone and create a gen emoji that looks just like them these are perfect for sharing with friends as a sticker reacting to messages with a tapback and you can even add gen Emoji in line in your messages let your imagination run wild as you create just the right gen emoji and because it's so much fun to use images to express ourselves we went even further with a new system experience we call image playground this is a new way to create playful images in just seconds it's so easy to use and we built it right into apps like messages to get started you can choose from a range of Concepts like themes costumes accessories places and more when you select them they get added to your playground no need to engineer the perfect prompt in a few seconds you'll see apple intelligence creates a preview of what your image could look like a moment later you'll see more previews you can swipe through this all happens on device so you have the freedom to experiment and create as many images as you want this is great for quickly responding to your friends with just the right image when you have a really specific idea in mind you could just type a description to add it to your playground and you can easily adjust which style you want to use [Music] and choose from animation sketch or illustration whichever suits the vibe of your conversation if you change your mind along the way no problem just switch back and you'll see your previous previews it's that simple since Apple intelligence understands your personal context you'll see suggestions for concepts related to your messages conversation including you and people from your messages thread when selected uses appearances from photos to add you or one of them to the image you're created with an intuitive experience to create totally original images and so many ways to express what you want the image playground is going to make everyday conversations a whole lot more fun in addition to messages this experience is also available in apps like keynote pages and free form to make it easy to experiment with creating images we've also built a dedicated image playground app you can use it to try out Styles play around with different concepts and make something to share with friends in other apps or on social media and for developers they can integrate the new image playground experience in their app too with a new API with the image playground experience and gen Emoji you can create fun and delightful images right where you need them now here's Seb to show you more experiences enabled by the powerful capabilities of Apple [Music] intelligence with the ability to deeply understand and create images Apple intelligence unlocks some fantastic new experiences like a brand new tool in the notes app that we call Image wand image wand can transform a rough sketch into a polished image that complements your notes and makes them more Visual and it's available right in your tool pallet suppose you want a better image for your architectural history course with image wand you can Circle your rough sketch using apple pencil to open up an image playground within your note image wand uses on device intelligence to analyze your sketch and words and creates an image for you what's really fun is that you can even Circle empty space and it will pull out contacts from the surrounding area to suggest the ideal image to go with your note it has never been easier to make your notes more Visual and engaging Apple intelligence also helps us make the most out of our ever growing photo libraries first we have an update to photo editing we've all had that time when we thought we got the perfect shot and realized later it wasn't quite perfect now the new cleanup tool will identify distracting objects in the background so you can make them disappear without accident L changing your subject plus searching for photos and videos is much more convenient because you can now use natural language phrases so you can search for really specific things like Maya skateboarding in a tie-dye shirt or Katie with stickers on her face search in videos is also more powerful with the ability to find a particular moment in the middle of a video clip so you can go right to the relevant segment when you search for that video of Maria cartwheeling on the grass Apple intelligence also makes it so much more delightful to create a memory movie today when you want to use your photos and videos to create a movie yourself like for your fishing trips with your kids it can take hours of work you have to search through tons of photos to pick out the best ones figure out how to arrange them and hunt for the right music now thanks to Apple intelligence it is super easy to create a memory about the story you want to see just type a description and it can interpret that learning to fish involves things like water docks fishing rods and boats using its language and image understanding Apple intelligence picks out the best photos and videos and then it crafts a storyline with unique chapters that are based on themes identified from your photos and arranges them into a movie with its own narrative Arc so now I can watch a wonderful memory that starts with my son practicing the dock transitions to fishing on the boat and finishes with us holding the price catch and all of this is set to the perfect song selected from Apple music like all of Apple intelligence these updates to photos are built on a foundation of privacy so your photos and videos are not shared with apple or anyone else with Endless Possibilities it is so much fun trying out different ideas and revisiting our most precious moments and now back to Craig Apple intelligence is truly unique in how it understands you and meets you where you are and what you saw here is just the beginning it enables so many more helpful features for example in the notes app you can now record and transcribe audio to capture detailed notes while staying present in the moment and when your recording is finished Apple intelligence generates a summary to help you recall the key points at a glance recordings transcriptions and apple intelligence powered summaries are also coming to the phone app and when you start a recording in a live call participants are automatically notified so no one is surprised Apple intelligence is available for free with IOS 18 iPad OS 18 and Mac OS Sequoia bringing you personal intelligence across the products you use every day still there are other artificial intelligence tools available that can be useful for tasks that drawn broad World Knowledge or offer specialized domain expertise we want you to be able to use these external models without having to jump between different tools so we're integrating them right into your experiences and we're starting out with the best of these the Pioneer and market leader chat GPT from open AI powered by GPT 40 first we built support into Siri so Siri can tap into chat gpt's expertise when it might be helpful for you for example if you need menu ideas for an elaborate meal to make for friends using some freshly caught fish and ingredients from your garden you can just ask Siri Siri determines that chat GPT might have good ideas for this ask your permission to share your question and presents the answer directly you can also include photos with your questions if you want some advice on decorating you can take a picture and ask what kind of plants would go well on this deck Siri can confirms if it's okay to share your photo with chat GPT and brings back relevant suggestions it's a seamless integration in addition to photos you can also ask questions related to your documents presentations or PDFs we've also integrated chat GPT into the systemwide writing tools with compose you can create content with chat GPT for whatever you're writing about suppose you want to create a custom bedtime story for your six-year-old who loves butterflies and solving riddles put in your initial IDE aide and send it to chat GPT to get something back she'll love compose can also help you tap into chat gpt's image capabilities to generate images in a wide variety of styles to illustrate your bedtime story you'll be able to access chat GPT for free without creating an account your requests and information will not be logged and for chat GPT subscribers you'll be able to connect your account and access paid features right within our experiences of course you're in control over when chat GPT is used and will be asked before any of your information is shared chat GPT integration will be coming to iOS 18 iPad OS 18 and Mac OS Sequoia later this year we also intend to add support for other AI models in the future now let's talk about developers and how they can integrate the experiences powered by Apple intelligence into their apps we've updated our sdks with new apis and Frameworks for example developers can add the image playground experience to their app with just a few lines of code this means that an app like craft can help users create images to make their documents much more Visual and writing tools are automatically available within apps that use the standard editable text view so without any development effort an app like bare notes can automatically allow users to rewrite proofread and summarize notes plus we're building many more ways for us to take action in apps with Siri if a developer has already adopted Siri kit they'll see immediate enhancements from many of Siri's new capabilities without additional work we're also investing deeply in the app intense framework to connect the vast world of apps with apple intelligence we're defining new intents across our operating systems and making them available to developers starting with these categories these intents are predefined trained and tested so that easy for developers to adopt using new app intents an app like dark room will be able to use the apply filter intent to give users the ability to say apply a cinematic preset to the photo I took of Ian yesterday these are just a handful of the updates coming to our platform SD so developers can add intelligent and useful features to their apps we'll share more details in the platform State of the Union later today like how we're bringing generative intelligence to xcode for developing apps using Swift and Swift Swift UI with features like on device code completion and smart assistance for Swift coding questions so that's Apple intelligence with tremendous benefits for developers and users this is AI for the rest of us personal intelligence you can rely on at work home and everywhere in between apple intelligence harnesses the power of our most advanced silicon and will be available on iPhone 15 Pro and iPad and Mac with M1 and later Apple intelligence will be available to try out in US English this summer we're bringing it to users in beta as part of iOS 18 iPad OS 18 and Mac OS Sequoia this fall with some features and additional languages and platforms coming out over the course of the next year this is the beginning of an exciting new chapter of personal intelligence intelligence built for your most personal products your iPhone iPad and Mac intelligence grounded in the things that make you you and intelligence available to you systemwide so you can get things done in the way that works for you we are just getting started and I hope you are as excited as I am for the road ahead and now back to Tim thank you Craig and thanks to all of our presenters it's been an exciting day of announcements we we shared powerful new features and advancements to our six incredible platforms and the introduction of powerful new Apple intelligence features to iOS 18 iPad OS 18 and Mac OS Sequoia make these releases game changers built in a uniquely apple way we think Apple intelligence is going to be indispensable to the products that already play such an integral role in our lives we have a big week ahead for developers it kicks off this afternoon with the platform State of the Union we also have over a 100 technical sessions live forums in-depth consultations and q&as with apple Engineers all of this content is available online for free for developers we're excited to provide developers with the amazing new OS platforms and Technologies we announced today as well as tools and resources to help them do the very best work of their lives thank you so much for joining us let's have a great [Music] WWDC for\"]"
