# Ask your videos

This project is a simple langchain project that allows users to ask questions and get answers from youtube videos.

## How it works

1. Youtube transcript is extracted from the video(s)
2. Transcripts are splitted into chunks of 800 characters (100 characters can overlap)
3. Each chunk is vectorized with openAI embedding API and put in a database
4. The user can query the database with a question and get the most relevant chunks
5. Langchain "stuff" to use the chunks to get the answer

## Strengths
- Can be used to search for information in videos
- Can be used to summarize videos
- Hallucinations are rare since the knowledge of the chatbot is finite and comes from the vector db
- It is able to answer 'I don't know' if the answer is not in the database

## Weaknesses
- Autogenerated transcript is sometimes disappointing, it would need a preprocessing step (adding punctation, removing unknown words or correct them)
- It looks hard to make links between chunks from different videos

## What's next

- [ ] Add a frontend to interact with the chatbot
- [ ] Add a way to load every videos in a playlist with a playlist link
- [ ] Add a way to load every videos from a channel with a channel link (AskYourYoutuber...?)
- [ ] Try more hyperparameters (chunk_size, overlap, top_k, temperature...)
